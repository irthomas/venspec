BIRA SNR MODEL

AIMS:
1) APPROXIMATELY REPRODUCE THE PHASE A OIP SNR STUDY RESULTS. RESULTS WITHIN A FEW % ARE ACCEPTABLE FOR COMPARISON AT THIS STAGE
2) WHEN THE PHASE B SNR MODEL IS FINALISED, THE RESULTS MUST MATCH EXACTLY
2) EXPAND THE MODEL TO TAKE REAL HIGH RESOLUTION INPUT SPECTRA, CONVOLVE TO DETECTOR PIXELS, AND CALCULATE ERROR ON EACH PIXEL RATHER THAN MEAN SNR
3) USE THE MODEL TO INVESTIGATE THE BEST OBSERVATION PARAMETERS FOR VENSPEC-H OPERATIONS


NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

CONTRIBUTION OF WARM SECTION (I.E. RADIATION PASSING THROUGH THE SLIT) TO THE NOISE CALCULATION (LOW IF WARM SECTION NOT TOO HOT)
RUNNING SIMULATION FOR BOTH DETECTOR GAIN SETTINGS AND CHOOSING THE BEST ONE
SIMULATE REAL SPECTRAL ACQUISITIONS: CALCULATE VENUS FRAME AND DARK FRAME SEPARATELY, DIGITISE OUTPUT, AND THEN SUBTRACT
