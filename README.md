# EnVision/VenSpec Python Scripts

## Getting started

Clone the repository to a directory on your local computer

Edit the paths file [tools/file/paths](tools/file/paths.py) to reflect the directory structure on your computer e.g. so paths["BASE_DIRECTORY"] points to the local directory of this repository; and paths["KERNEL_ROOT_DIRECTORY"] points to the directory containing the EnVision SPICE kernels
